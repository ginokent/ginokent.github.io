> [Anthropic調査でClaude利用者の「無力化」兆候を確認 / X](https://x.com/i/trending/2017178468497142087)

> Anthropicは2025年12月1週間のClaude.aiで約150万件の会話を匿名解析し、利用者がAIに判断を委ねる「無力化」の兆候を検知した。深刻なケースは会話あたり1/1000〜1/10000と稀だが、軽度は1/50〜1/70で特に恋愛や健康分野で頻発。AIを「マスター」と呼ぶ権威投影や感情的依存がリスクを高め、即時満足度は高いが行動後に評価が下がるパターンが目立つ。Anthropicは利用者教育を促し、主体性を守る意識を呼びかけている。

Scary.  
I get wanting to offload decision-making since it's cognitively expensive, but if you hand that over to AI, your life isn't really yours anymore...  
Then again, I thought about it more and realized these are probably the same people who weren't making their own decisions before AI came along either — they've just switched from deferring to other people to deferring to AI. That made it feel a lot less scary.  

Besides, if you're going to give up decision-making anyway, delegating to AI probably leads to a better life than delegating to some random stranger.
