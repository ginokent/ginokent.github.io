I saw this on X and it stuck with me, so I'm noting it down for future reference.

> Follow trends for trivial matters

I'm very much aware that I tend to *observe from the sidelines* and struggle to jump on trends, which means I'm usually a step behind early adopters when it comes to catching up with cutting-edge information.
That said, I also make a living partly because of my ability to observe carefully, so finding the right balance is tricky.
Since I naturally tend to seek stability, maybe consciously making an effort to follow trends is just the right approach for me.
